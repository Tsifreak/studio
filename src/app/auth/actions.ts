// loginUser, signupUser are removed as AuthContext handles this directly with Firebase client SDK.

// forgotPassword and updateUserProfile functionality will also be handled by AuthContext

// If specific server-side actions are still needed for auth (e.g., interacting with a custom backend
// in conjunction with Firebase), they would be defined here, possibly using Firebase Admin SDK.
// For now, these are effectively replaced.
