## Core Features:

- Store Directory: Display a directory-like listing of all stores with key information like store name, logo, and a brief description. The homepage includes search and filtering options to help users find specific stores or types of stores, and allow for sorting by rating.
- Store Detail Page: Dedicated pages for each store with detailed information, including name, logo, description, pricing plans, features, and user reviews. Use clear, structured layouts to present the information effectively. Pages should display the products offered.
- User Authentication Flow: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Implement secure authentication and authorization to protect user data. Store user-specific preferences to tailor their shopping experience. Enable 'remember me' and 'forget password' features. Display a personalized dashboard to help manage settings and preferences.
- Contact/Query Form: A form on each store's detail page that allows users to send queries or requests directly to the store. Include fields for name, email, subject, and message, with validation to ensure all required fields are completed. Submit the request directly to the store owners by invoking the store's APIs using server actions, where each store implements its own webhooks. Limit the size and frequency of submission attempts to discourage spam.
